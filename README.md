## Personal Portfolio
### mahmoudhilani.com

This is a portfolio built on Next.js to showcase the projects I have worked on during my years since I got into computer science.

Proud of the Front-End work, although not much happening in the backend. 
Custom modular components with some libraries used as a base.
Built with simplicity in mind to focus on more serious software related projects.

Deployed on Vercel.
